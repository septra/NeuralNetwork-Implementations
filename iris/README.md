## Iris classification

This network consists of an input layer with 4 input features corresponding to the sepal and petal width and height as present in the Iris dataset. 
The hidden layer is made up of five nodes and the output layer consists of only one node as this network does not handle multi-class classification. Instead, it is a binary classifier that tries to learn the features for versicolor alone.
